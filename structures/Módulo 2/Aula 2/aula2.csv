In those days;there also lived an old soldier called Jack Hannaford, 001
His coat was old and he was poor, 002
but nobody thought that Jack Hannaford was stupid, 003
He was sly like a fox, 004
When he left the army, 005
he walked all around the country, 006
looking for ways to play his tricks, 007
After he had traveled for some time, 008
he came across the farm belonging to the pair, 009
He knocked on the door of the house, 010
and a moment later;the wife answered, 011
She looked him up and down;quite astonished, 012
because few strangers were able to make the difficult journey to theirhome, 013
“Where did you come from?” she asked, 014
